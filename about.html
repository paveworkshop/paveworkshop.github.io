	<img src="res/graduation-profile.jpg" alt="Graduation Speech at the Royal Institution">

	<p>	
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-clarke-86473123b/">Alex Clarke</a> is a designer, computer scientist and interdisciplinary researcher. 
		<br><br>
		He spends as much time in the workshop building physical prototypes as he does writing code. He is always keen to create recipes rather than products.
		<br><br>
		His artistic work fuses sculpture and simulation, creating highly-interactive new media using projection mapping, computer vision and robotics, and culminating in light shows at <i>Corsica Studios</i> and his latest exhibitions, <i>Digital Bloom</i> and <i>Cascades</i>.
		<br><br>
		As a software engineer and CAD specialist he has worked for architects and robotics startups, taken a leading role in a UCL Computer Science research centred on gestural computing, taught Masters students to code, and built a range of mechatronics prototypes for clients.
		<br><br>
		He is passionate about creative and project-based education, seeking to translate scientific research into intuitive form. His current research brings a growing interest in biological complexity to his practice, recently completing his MASc at the <i>London Interdisciplinary School</i> where he looked at the simulation challenges faced by living systems, using machine learning to mimic the way collectives of leaf cells ‘chatter’ through biochemical signaling.
